# Chapter three of ‘In Plain Sight’ by Gloria Farley

#### You know, there are just so many ship carvings in North america. I know I have done about three articles on this topic alone, but I just think it is so interesting! I wanna tell you about some really clearly drawn images of ships that have been discovered in places like Arizona, colorado, and more. These images are just so fascinating because for example in one of them there is a clear ship with oars that closely mimics a phonician ship on a coin found in one of their settlements in the old world, in another there is a clear greek or on first glance viking ship, and under it there are letters that possibly spell out “the ship” in south iberian punic written beneath it. There are so many fascinating examples of these images that I just love to read about, and I would absolutely recommend that anyone who wants to learn about history should do the same!

But enough of the talk, let's talk about some of the images. So first off, there is a very well drawn ship in hicklin springs, co. this ship appears to be phonician in design, but you may be asking “well how do you know it was phonician?”

The answer is that we have found a phonician coin in the ruins of one of their former settlements, which clearly depicts a ship. This ship has oars, a bow, and many other distinguishing features of a ship, and is widely regarded as a ship by most historians. There is an almost identical ship of this design pecked into a wall in hicklin springs, which bears many things in common, including a backwards ‘p’ on what appears to be a rudder. This would not have been a “p” sound we are so used to, but was instead a ra sound, possibly meaning a ship of Ra, an egyptian god of the sun.

But another petroglyph, found in Arizona, is even more clear. It shows a possibly Greek ship sailing away into the distance, with waves and everything! This is one of the most clear and identifiable ships i have ever seen in rock art, as it has so many distinguishing features of a ship, a mast, rectangle sail, a rope clearly holding it back, and a bow that looks like a viking or greek style rowing ship. Beside the ship carving there is a script that has been identified as south punic iberian. The spelling translated out today says S S F N. In ancient iberian there is no ff sound, just a ph sound, but in arabic there is. In Arabic this would spell out “essafin” , or the ship in modern english. Note in ancient languages like this there are no vowels, so if someone wanted to say “cat” they would write ct, next to an image of a cat to signify the message.

There are so many carvings like that it just makes my head spin. Things like ancient writing, old ship carvings and historic links to the old world really make you question the very reality of what we know about history, am i right? And i promise, i'll eventually move on from ancient ships, and get into some more of the ancient lore that is associated with the old world and the new, but until then, be prepared for some more ship themed content!
